# Order-MVC-.NET-Web-App
Small web application used to implement MVC .NET fundamental functionalities

DEFINITION OF THE TASK:
Description:
Create pages in ASP MVC to handle Orders in two tables with full CRUD Operations
- Master Table: - Orders
Contains columns: - order ID, Date, Customer Id, Total Amount
- Details Table: - Order Items
Contains columns: - order Items Id, Item ID, Unit Id, Amount
Required features:
- Basic user management (Add – Edit – Update – Delete).
- Login.
- Orders management (Add – Edit – Update – Delete).

1. Validation is very important.
2. Coding readability.
3. Use EF Code first.
4. Implement User management ASP User Membership.

WHAT HAVE I COMPLETED:
- Created Log in form, Orders List form, Edit form, Create form, Delete options
- Used Entity Framework to create and connect to Code-First Local DataBase
- Default and Custom Validation examples
- Handling HTTP POST AND HTTP GET Request

WHAT IS MISSING AND WHAT HAS TO BE IMPROVED:
- havent completed creation of the order
- user managment is partial, log in should be enabled for customers from database
- using a framework like Angular and React would improve front end development process and separation of concerns, aswell as the design and user friendliness


PROBLEMS I HAVE ENCOUNTERED THAT CAN BE FURTHER DISCUSSED AND WORKED ON:
- Data Binding of complex Models and how to always hand this efficiently in MVC .NET, when to relay only on .NET framework when on JS 
- Authorisation and Authentication simple solutions for smaller applications vs more complex solutions that guaranty data safety
